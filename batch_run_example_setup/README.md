This folder contains 4 files that were used to set up a WBM batch run.  A batch run is an ensemble of WBM simulations, usually based on an ensemble of climate inputs. In this case, the LOCA climate ensemble is used. 

Instructioins for setting up a batch run:
1. edit batch_make_init.pl.  This script generates all the wbm run files (.init) based on a template or set of tempaltes. In this case, the templates are:
USNE_drought_cmip5_historical.init and USNE_drought_cmip5_TEMPLATE_RCP.init.
Each template is a wbm run file with placeholders in the character strings for all the input climate driver file names. The .pl script generates a set of wbm run files that replaces these placeholders with the actual names.

2. edit wbm_batch_run_MSB.pl.  This script launches each individual ensemble WBM simulation, based on the character strings of the .init files generated by step 1.

Note, these .pl scripts could also easily be written in bash or any other programming language. This is just an example of how to set up many WBM simulations at once.
